//================Java class to output 'Hello World'============================>
//Running 'javac MyClass.java' will compile code and flag errors if any exist.
//After successfully running compiler successfully run java MyClass
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

//***Note - java is case sensitive.  MyClass and myclass will be treated as different by Java */

// ALSO important fact that name of file MUST equal the name of class
